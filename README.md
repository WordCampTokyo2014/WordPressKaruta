WordPress Karuta (Card Game)
====
## Overview
Karuta is a Japanese card game.
We applied traditional karuta to make this WordPress card game.

## Description
The basic idea is to be able to quickly determine which card out of an array of cards is required and then to grab the card before it is grabbed by an opponent.

## How to play
There are two kinds of cards used in karuta. One kind is yomifuda (読札) or "reading cards", and the other is torifuda (取り札) or "grabbing cards." As they were denoted, the words in the yomifuda are read and players will have to find its associated torifuda before anybody else does.
